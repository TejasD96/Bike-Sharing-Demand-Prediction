# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

Project Overview :This project focuses on developing a predictive regression model to forecast hourly rental demand for Yulu bikes. The model analyzes various factors, including weather conditions and time-based patterns, to assist in optimizing bike availability and enhancing operational efficiency.

Dataset The dataset includes hourly rental data with features such as:

* Date & Hour
* Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Solar Radiation, Rainfall, Snowfall
* Seasons, Holiday, Functioning Day
* Rented Bike Count (Target Variable)

# Project Workflow

1. Data Exploration Loaded the dataset and performed an initial assessment. Evaluated each variable and its impact on rental count.
2. Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values and outliers. Derived new features such as weekday/weekend classification.
3. Data Visualization Univariate Analysis: Distribution of individual features. Bivariate Analysis: Relationship between rental count and influencing factors. Multivariate Analysis: Correlation and pattern analysis.
4. Model Implementation Implemented three regression models:
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor Evaluated performance using R² score and cross-validation techniques.
5. Model Improvement & Selection Used K-Fold Cross-Validation to improve generalization. Compared model performances and selected the best-performing model. Saved the final model using Joblib for future predictions.
  
# Key Insights & Business Impact

1. Weather significantly influences rental demand; integrating weather forecasts can optimize operations.
2. Peak demand occurs during office rush hours, emphasizing the need for proper bike distribution.
3. Winter months show lower demand, providing an opportunity for maintenance and development.
4. Promotional offers during low-demand periods may help boost rentals.
   
 Model Usage Yulu can use the trained Joblib model to predict demand for future time periods. By inputting relevant weather and time-based parameters, the model can estimate whether a given hour or day will experience high or low demand, aiding in:

* Better fleet management
* Resource optimization
* Enhanced customer experience
  
# Future Scope :

* Enhance predictions with deep learning models.
* Integrate real-time weather API for dynamic forecasting.
* Deploy the model as a web-based application for real-time insights.
